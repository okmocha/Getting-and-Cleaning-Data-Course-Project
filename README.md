# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. I was required to submit: 1) a tidy data set 2) a link to a Github repository with my script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. I was also required to include a README.md in the repo with my scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
